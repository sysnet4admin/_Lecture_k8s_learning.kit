spec:
  nodeName: w5-k8s  # Direct placement on w5-k8s node (has ssd and gpu taint)
  # Note: nodeName bypasses ALL scheduler checks including taints
  # Even though w5-k8s has gpu=nvidia:NoSchedule taint, this pod will be scheduled
  # because nodeName skips the scheduler entirely
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd  # Ignored by scheduler, but w5-k8s has ssd so kubelet admission passes
